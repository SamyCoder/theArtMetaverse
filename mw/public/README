File structure

  mw/

     Contains files accessible by web URLs from a web client
     that the Mirror Worlds server uses internally.
     These files came from the Mirror Worlds project source
     repository.  By default these files are accessible via
     the URL like http(s)://host.bla.bla:1234/mw/PATH, where
     PATH is the file path relative to this mw/ directory.
     The 'mw' part of this URL directs the HTTP mirror worlds
     server to get files from here.


  ./

     Except for files in mw/, this directory the default location files
     for a particular running mirror worlds service.  It's a place that a
     particular mirror worlds service gets custom files that are not from
     the mirror worlds built-in source code.
